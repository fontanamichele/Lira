## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account
- Custom asset pricing API provider with the following endpoints:
  - `GET /prices/current?tickers={ticker1,ticker2}&currency={currency}`
  - `GET /prices/historical?tickers={ticker1,ticker2}&currency={currency}&period={period}&interval={interval}`

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd lira
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Copy the `.env.local` file and update it with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### 4. Set up Asset Pricing API

1. Configure your asset pricing API provider domain in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY_API_URL=https://your-asset-pricing-api-provider.com
```

The API provider should support the following endpoints:

- **Current prices**: `GET /prices/current?tickers={ticker1}&tickers={ticker2}&currency={currency}`
- **Historical prices**: `GET /prices/historical?tickers={ticker1}&tickers={ticker2}&currency={currency}&period={period}&interval={interval}`

**Ticker formats**:

- **Currencies**: `{CURRENCY}USD=X` (e.g., `EURUSD=X` for EUR to USD conversion)
- **Stocks/ETFs**: Direct ticker (e.g., `AAPL`, `SPY`, `QQQ`)
- **Cryptocurrencies**: `{CRYPTO}-USD` (e.g., `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`)

**Example API calls**:

- EUR to USD: `/prices/current?tickers=EURUSD%3DX&currency=EUR`
- Apple stock: `/prices/current?tickers=AAPL&currency=USD`
- Bitcoin: `/prices/current?tickers=BTC-USD&currency=USD`
- S&P 500 ETF: `/prices/current?tickers=SPY&currency=USD`

### 5. Set up the database

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` into the editor
4. Run the SQL to create all necessary tables, policies, and functions

### 6. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Database Schema

The app uses four main tables:

- **profiles**: User profile information (nickname, main currency)
- **accounts**: Bank accounts (name, user reference)
- **account_balances**: Asset balances per account (currency, category, current_balance)
- **transactions**: Income, expense, and transfer records linked to specific asset balances

**Key Features**:

- **Multi-Asset Support**: Each balance has a category (currency, stock, etf, crypto) and ticker
- **Automatic Balance Creation**: Balances are created automatically when adding income/transfer transactions
- **No Initial Amounts**: Balances start at 0 and are updated through transactions
- **Row Level Security**: All tables include RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own data
